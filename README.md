After cloning, in the "BTT Settings" folder and open "triggers.bttpreset", then replace:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"BTTAppleScriptFilePath" : "\\/Users\\/super\\/Desktop\\/important\\/SystemFiles\\/"

replace all with:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"BTTAppleScriptFilePath" : "path to where you want your applescripts"

(and don't forget to add backslashes back in!)

and finally, import the triggers (in "BTT Settings" folder) to BetterTouchTool in order to use the scripts
